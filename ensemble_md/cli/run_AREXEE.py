"""
Currently, this CLI still uses MPI to run REXEE simulations, but it tries to mock some behaviors of asynchronous REXEE in the following way:
1. Finish an iteration of the REXEE simulation. 
2. Based on the time it took for each simulation to finish, figure out the order in which the replicas should be added to the queue. 
3. Apply a queueing algorithm to figure out what replicas to swap first.

Eventually, we would like to get rid of the use of MPI and really rely on asynchronous parallelization schemes. The most likely
direction is to use functionalities in airflowHPC to manage the queueing and launching of replicas. If possible, this CLI should be
integrated into the CLI run_REXEE.
